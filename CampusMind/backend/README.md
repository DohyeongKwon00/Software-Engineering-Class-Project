## Connect and create database for user

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app: locate in the same directory with app.js in the terminal

   ```bash
    node app.js 
   ```
   or
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Create new user: create a new terminal then locate to the directory where test.js is at

    ```
    node test.js
    ```

> You can always create double check by go to MongoDB Compass or the website with your local database.   
> You can also create a new user at the bottom of the file test.js by adjusting the string.
